            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How ≈øundry ≈øacred texts have been thus perverted of later yeers, not by the<note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.16</note> 
               <hi>unlearned and un≈øtable vulgar,</hi> but by the greate≈øt <hi>Seraphicall Doctors</hi> in our Church, is too apparent unto all; and among others that of the P≈øalmi≈øt, P≈øal. 105.15. (which is repeated 1 Chron. 16.22.) <hi>Touch not mine Anoynted, and do my Prophets no harm;</hi> hath not had the lea≈øt violence offered it, both in <hi>Pre≈ø≈øe</hi> and <hi>Pulpit,</hi> to cry up the <hi>ab≈øolute irre≈øi≈øtable Prerogative of Kings</hi> in all their exorbitant proceedings; and beat down the <hi>ju≈øt liberties of the Subject,</hi> without the lea≈øt defen≈øive oppo≈øition; when as this text, in real verity, is rather a direct precept given to Kings them≈øelves, not to oppre≈ø≈øe or injure their faithful ≈øubjects, then an injunction given to ≈øubjects, not to defend them≈øelves again≈øt the oppre≈ø≈øive de≈øtructive wars, and projects of their Princes. In which regard it wil be no <hi>un≈øea≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> nor <hi>ungratefull</hi> worke, to cleare this text from all fal≈øe Glo≈ø≈øes, and re≈øtore it to its proper con≈øtruction.</p>
            <p>In former ages when popery domineered, the <hi>popi≈øh Clergy</hi> grounded their <hi>pretended exemption from all temporall juri≈ødiction on this Scripture;</hi> ≈øugge≈øting, <hi>that they onely, at lea≈øt principally were Gods Anointed here intended; and therefore ought not be touched nor apprehended by Kings or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Iudges for any crimes.</hi> But this fal≈øe Glo≈ø≈øe being long ≈øince exploded, many <hi>Court Divines,</hi> not ≈øo much to <hi>≈øecure</hi> as <hi>flatter</hi> Kings, have applyed it primarily unto <hi>Kings,</hi> and ≈øecundarily to <hi>Prie≈øts,</hi> as meant of them alone, excluding their faithfull Subjects out of its protection and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits; when as the text is meant of none el≈øe but they in general, and of <hi>Abraham, I≈øaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> with <hi>their families</hi> in particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To put this out of que≈øtion: you mu≈øt fir≈øt ob≈øerve, that this P≈øalm from the 5 ver≈øe to the end, is meerely hi≈øtoricall. The 7 fir≈øt ver≈øes of it are but a gratulatory preamble (interlaced with ≈øome exhortations) to the ≈øub≈øequent hi≈øtoricall narration; as he that reads them advi≈øedly will at fir≈øt acknowledge: In the 8, 9, 10, &amp; 11. ver≈øes, the P≈øalmi≈øt begins his hi≈øtory, with the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which God made to</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the oath which he ≈øware to</hi> I≈øaac; <hi>and confirmed the ≈øame unto</hi> Jacob <hi>for a law, and to</hi> I≈ørael <hi>for an everla≈øting te≈øtament: ≈øaying, unto thee will I give the land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>the lot of your inheritance.</hi> In the 12, 13, 14, &amp; 15. ver≈øes, he expre≈ø≈øeth the ≈øpecial care and protection of God over <hi>Abraham, I≈øaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and their ≈øeveral families after his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant thus made unto them, in the≈øe words: <hi>When they</hi> (to wit, Abraham, I≈øaac, and Jacob, with their families) <hi>were but a few men in number, yea very few and ≈øtrangers in it: When they went from one Nation to another, from one Kingdom to another people</hi> (which cannot po≈ø≈øibly be expounded of Kings and Prie≈øts, but onely of tho≈øe Patriarcks) <hi>He ≈øuffered no man to doe them wrong, but reproved even Kings for their ≈øakes, ≈øaying, Touch not mine Aroynted, and doe my Prophets no harme.</hi> Then in the very next ver≈øe to the end of the P≈øalm, he proceeds with the ≈øtory of the <hi>famine in Egypt,</hi> and of <hi>Io≈øephs ≈øending thither beforehand by God, &amp;c.</hi> So that by the expre≈ø≈øe words and ≈øeries of the ≈øtory in this P≈øalm, the≈øe per≈øons of whom God ≈øaid, <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and do my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets no harme,</hi> were <hi>Abraham, I≈øaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and their families, (as S. <hi>Augu≈øtin</hi> with ≈øundry other Expo≈øiters of this P≈øalm conclude;) who in truth were neither Kings nor Prie≈øts by office, but onely Gods peculiar people and ≈øervants: of whom he took ≈øpecial care. Whence I thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, in the fir≈øt place.</p>
            <p>The≈øe words, <hi>Touch not mine anointed, &amp;c.</hi> were originally ≈øpoken and intended only of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, I≈øaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob, and their families,</hi> who were neither actual Kings not Prie≈øts; &amp; they were meant of them, not as they were Kings or Prie≈øts, but only as they were the ≈øervants
<pb facs="tcp:124684:2"/>and cho≈øen people of God; as is evident by the 6 ver≈øe of this P≈øalm, <hi>O ye ≈øeed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>his SERVANT, ye children of</hi> Jacob <hi>his CHOSEN.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore they are to be ≈øo interpreted; and to be applyed not to Kings and Prie≈øts, as they are ≈øuch; but only to the faithful ≈øervants and cho≈øen people of God, though, and as ≈øubjects.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Con≈øider to whom the≈øe words were ≈øpoken; not to <hi>Subjects,</hi> but to <hi>Kings</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; as the P≈øalmi≈øt re≈øolves in expre≈ø≈øe terms, Ver≈ø. 14. <hi>He ≈øuffered no man to do them wrong, but reproved even KINGS for their ≈øakes; ≈øaying,</hi> (even to Kings them≈øelves) <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harme.</hi> Now that the≈øe words were ≈øpoken to Kings them≈øelves is apparent, by tho≈øe hi≈øtories to which the≈øe words relate, recorded at large, <hi>Gene≈ø.</hi> 12.10. to 20, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. throughout, and <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.1. to 17. and ver≈ø. 29. <hi>Where when</hi> Abraham <hi>by rea≈øon of the famine went down into</hi> Egypt, <hi>with</hi> Sarah <hi>his wife, and King</hi> Pharaoh <hi>tooke her into his hou≈øe, God fir≈øt permitted neither</hi> Fharaoh <hi>nor his ≈øervants to do either of them any injury</hi> (<hi>though</hi> Abraham <hi>out of over-much feare, ≈øu≈øpected they would have killed him, and therefore made</hi> Sarah <hi>≈øay ≈øhe was his ≈øi≈øter,</hi>) <hi>and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe plagued</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and his ≈øervants becau≈øe of</hi> Sarah Abrahams <hi>wife; whereupon they and all theirs went away in ≈øafety. After which</hi> Abraham <hi>and his wife ≈øojourning in</hi> Gerar, Abimelech <hi>king of</hi> Gerar <hi>≈øent and took</hi> Sarah: <hi>But God ≈øaid to</hi> Abimelech <hi>in a dream, behold thou art a dead man for the woman that thou hast taken, for ≈øhe is a mans wife, &amp;c.

            <p n="1">1. That this inhibition, given to Kings them≈øelves with reference to ≈øubjects, and the people of God, cannot properly be meant of Kings and Prie≈øts, but of ≈øubjects fearing God. It is mo≈øt apparant, that Kings, Princes and Rulers of the earth have alwaies been the greate≈øt enemies and per≈øecutors of Gods <hi>anointed ones,</hi> to wit, of Chri≈øt and his cho≈øen members; witne≈ø≈øe P≈ø. 2.2. &amp; Act. 3.26, 27. <hi>The Kings of the Earth ≈øet them≈øelves, and the Rulers take coun≈øell together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Lord, &amp; again≈øt his</hi> anoynted: <hi>For of a truth</hi> again≈øt <hi>the holy child Ie≈øus, whom thou ha≈øt</hi> anointed, <hi>both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and people of I≈ørael were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. And now Lord behold their threatnings.</hi> Which truth you may ≈øee exemplified by P≈ø. 119.23, 161. Ier. 26.21, 22, 23. c. 36.26. c. 37.15. c. 38.4, 5, 6. Ezek. 22.6.7, 27, 28.

Act. 12.1, 2, 3. with ≈øundry other Scriptures, and by all eccle≈øia≈øtical hi≈øtories ≈øince. In which regard God in his infinite wi≈ødome gave this divine inhibition, not to ≈øubjects and inferiour per≈øons; but to Kings, Princes, and the greate≈øt Potentates (who, deem their wils a law, and think they may doe what they plea≈øe to their godly ≈øubjects,) <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harme:</hi> which being ≈øpoken to Kings them≈øelves; it cannot be meant of Kings but ≈øubjects; unle≈ø≈øe you wil make this non≈øence expo≈øition of it. <hi>That Kings mu≈øt not touch nor hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; and that it is unlawfull for one King to make war again≈øt, impri≈øon, depo≈øe, or kill another:</hi>

            <p n="2">2. That all Gods faithfull people are <hi>Gods anoynted,</hi> as well as Kings: and therefore as our <hi>Court Cycophants</hi> conclude from hence, That Subjects may in no wi≈øe take up Armes (though meerely defen≈øive) again≈øt their Kings, becau≈øe they are Gods anoynted: ≈øo by the ≈øelf-≈øame rea≈øon, the genuine proper meaning and expre≈ø≈øe re≈øolution of this text, Kings ought not to take up Armes again≈øt their ≈øubjects, e≈øpecially tho≈øe profe≈ø≈øing the true feare of God, becau≈øe they are Gods anoynted to, as well as Kings.</p>
            <p>If any Court-Chaplaine here demand; how I prove beleeving Subjects fearing God, to be hi≈ø annointed, as wel as Kings or Prie≈øts?</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer: fir≈øt, the Scripture re≈øolves expre≈øly: <hi>That all true Chri≈øtians are really</hi> (in a ≈øpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ≈øence) <hi>both</hi>

               <hi>Kings and Prie≈øts to God the Father,</hi> though they be but ≈øubjects in a politicke ≈øence: yea, <hi>God hath prepared a heavenly kingdome, (with an eternal Crown of glory) for them, where they ≈øhall raigne with Chri≈øt for ever and ever.</hi> Math. 5.3. c. 25.34.

            <p>Secondly, all true Chri≈øtians are <hi>members of Chri≈øt and of his body, fle≈øh and bone; and made one with Chri≈øt,</hi> who dwelleth in them, and they in him, 1 Cor. 12.12, 17.

               <hi>anoyntment</hi> in, by, and from Chri≈øt, and his Spirit, 1 Iohn 2.27. <hi>But the ANOYNTING which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not any man teach you, but as the ≈øame ANOINTING teacheth you of all things.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are really and truely <hi>Gods anoynted,</hi> and may be as properly ≈øo phra≈øed, as any Kings and Prie≈øts what≈øoever.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Scripture in direct terms oft cals Gods people, (though ≈øubjects) <hi>Gods anointed:</hi> as P≈øal. 28.8, 9. <hi>The Lord is their ≈øtrength, and he is the ≈øaving health of his anoynted.</hi> Now who tho≈øe are, is expre≈ø≈øed in the following words, <hi>Save thy people, ble≈ø≈øe thine inheritance, guide them and lift them up for ever.</hi> Gods people are here defined to be <hi>his anoynted.</hi> So P≈øal. 18.50. <hi>And ≈øheweth mercy to his anointed;</hi> (but who are they?) <hi>to David and to his ≈øeed for ever more,</hi> that is, to Chri≈øt and his elect children, here called <hi>Gods anointed,</hi> Habakuck. 3.13. <hi>Thou wente≈øt forth for the ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy people, even for ≈øalvation with thine anointed.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.21. <hi>Now he which e≈øtabli≈øheth us in Chri≈øt, and hath anointed us, is God, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Ioh. 2.27. <hi>The anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, &amp;c.</hi> All the≈øe, with other Scriptures, thus re≈øolving Gods people (though ≈øubjects) to be his <hi>anointed ones;</hi> they may be properly ≈øaid to be the per≈øons ≈øpecified in this text. <hi>Touch not mine anointed;</hi> being an injunction given to Kings them≈øelves, and not meant of Kings, but of Gods people, as I have formerly manife≈øted.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhal willingly and cordially profe≈ø≈øe, that Kings in ≈øacred writ, are commonly called, <hi>Gods anointed;</hi> becau≈øe <hi>they were u≈øually anointed with Oyle upon their inauguration to their Throns,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.1. c. 15, 17. c. 12.3, 5. c. 16, 3, c. 12.13. c. 24.6, 10. c. 26.6, 11.16, 23.2 Sam. 1.14, 16. c. 2.4, 7 1 King. 1.34, 39, 45. 2 King. 9.3, 6, 12. 2. Chron. 6.42. P≈øal. 20.6. P≈øal. 89.20, 38, 51. P≈øal. 92.12. P≈øal. 132.10, 17. E≈øay 45.1. Lam. 4.20. And in this regard <hi>their per≈øons are ≈øacred, and no violence
<pb facs="tcp:124684:3"/>ought to be exerci≈øed upon their per≈øons, e≈øpecially by their ≈øubjects,</hi> as is cleare by the 1 Sam. 24.3. to 12, 17, 18, 19. ch. 26.7. to 25. 2 Sam. 1.2, to 17. And hereupon this text, <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and doe my Prophets no harme,</hi> though not properly meant of Kings, may yet be aptly applyed to their per≈øonal ≈øafety. But then I ≈øay, on the contrary part, That all Gods Saints and people, though ≈øubjects, <hi>are his anointed ones</hi> as wel as Kings; wherefore Kings mu≈øt no more offer violence to their per≈øons or e≈øtates (without legal conviction and ju≈øt cau≈øe) then they offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to their Kings, which I ≈øhall thus make cleare.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, becau≈øe God hath given this expre≈ø≈øe injunction even to Kings them≈øelves, <hi>Touch not mine anointed,</hi> (that is your ≈øubjects, my faithful ≈øervants) <hi>and doe my Prophets no harme,</hi> P≈øal. 105.14, 15. 1 Chro. 16.21, 12. Prohibiting <hi>Abimelech, and he his ≈øubjects ≈øo much as to touch Abraham, Sarah, or I≈øaac,</hi> Gen. 20.6. c. 26, 11, 29.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becau≈øe <hi>he that toucheth them</hi> (to doe them harme) <hi>toucheth the very apple of Gods eye.</hi> Zeph. 2.8. P≈øal. 17.8, 9. Deut. 32.9 10, 11. Yea, <hi>per≈øecuteth God, nay Chri≈øt him≈øelfe.</hi> E≈øay 63.9 Math. 25.45. Act. 9 4, 5. And what Kings, how great ≈øoever, may or dare touch or per≈øecute God and Chri≈øt, <hi>the King of Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, becau≈øe God him≈øelfe hath quite extirpated Kings and their po≈øterities, for offering violence to his ≈øervants, though their ≈øubjects. Thus <hi>Ahab, Iezabel, and their po≈øterity were de≈øtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for putting Naboth to death, and ≈øeizing on his Vineyard wrongfully without cau≈øe, though under a pretext of law,</hi> 1 King. 21. &amp; 22. 2 King. 9. So King <hi>Joa≈øh exciting his people to ≈øtone the prophet Zachariah without good cau≈øe, which they did at his commandement; the Princes and people who did it were ≈øoon after de≈øtroyed by the Syrians; and the Kings own ≈øervants con≈øpired again≈øt him for the blood of Zachariah, and ≈ølew him on his bed, and then buried him di≈øhonourably, not in the Sepulchre of the Kings,</hi> So as his prayer at his death <hi>(the Lord look upon it and require it)</hi> was fully executed on the King and people, 2 Chron. 24.20. to 27. Thus King <hi>Iehoahaz, Iehorachin, and Iehoiachim with all their Princes and people were carried away captive into Babylon, and de≈øtroyed, for mocking, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing, and de≈øpi≈øing Gods me≈ø≈øengers, prophets, and people,</hi> 2 Chron. 36.16, 17. Many ≈øuch in≈øtances might be added, but the≈øe may ≈øuffice; and that of the King of <hi>Babilon,</hi> E≈øay 14.4, 19.20, 21, 22. <hi>But thou art ca≈øt out of thy grave as an abominable branch, &amp;c. as a carca≈øe troden under feet. Thou ≈øhalt not be joyned with them in buriall.</hi> BECAUSE THOU HAST DESTROYED THY LAND, AND SLAINE THY PEOPLE: <hi>the ≈øeed of evil doers ≈øhall never be renowned. Prepare ye ≈ølaughter for his children, for the iniquity of their fathers, that they do not ri≈øe, nor po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe the Land, nor fill the face of the world with cities. For I will ri≈øe up again≈øt them, ≈øaith the Lord of Ho≈øts, and cut off from Babylon the name and remembrance, and ≈øons, and nephews, ≈øaith the Lord.</hi> A notable text for oppre≈ø≈øing Princes to meditate upon.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becau≈øe God him≈øelfe hath given an expre≈ø≈øe command, Ezek. 44.15, 16, 17. <hi>That the Prince ≈øhall not take of the peoples inheritance by oppre≈ø≈øion to thru≈øt them out of their po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, but he ≈øhall give his ≈øonnes inheritance out of his own po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion.</hi> Which wel interpreteth and fully an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that much abu≈øed text in the 1 Sam. 8.11, 12, 19. and proves <hi>the Kings taking of their Folds, Vineyards, Oliveyards, Seed and Sheep to give his ≈øervants</hi> there ≈øpecified, to be a meere oppre≈ø≈øion; <hi>which ≈øhould make them cry out in that day becau≈øe of their King, ver≈ø.</hi> 18. and no lawful act, as ≈øome royali≈øts glo≈ø≈øe it. If then Kings may not take away by violence or oppre≈ø≈øion their ≈øubjects lands or goods; muchles may they offer violence to their per≈øons, being Gods anointed, yea his <hi>Temple,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19. c. 3.16. <hi>And if any man (be he King or Emperour) de≈øtroy the Temple of God, him will God de≈øtroy; for the Temple of God is holy, which Temple they are,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.17. Hence <hi>Ioab, Davids</hi> General, <hi>comming to be≈øiege Abel to which Sheha fled, a woman of that place thus expo≈øtulated with him, thou ≈øeekest to de≈øtroy a City and mother in I≈ørael: why wilt thou ≈øwallow up the inheritance of the Lord?</hi> Whereupon <hi>Ioab an≈øwered and ≈øaid: far be it, far be it from me that I ≈øhould ≈øwallow up or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy,</hi> 2 Sam. 20.19, 20.</p>

                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>tly, becau≈øe no law of God or man hath given any authority <hi>to Kings to injure</hi> or oppre≈ø≈øe <hi>their ≈øubjects, in body lands or goods, but onely to feed, defend, protect them; and to fight their battels for
<pb facs="tcp:124684:4"/>them,</hi> not to wage war again≈øt them. 2 Sam. 6.2. c. 23.3. P≈øal. 78.72, 73, 74. 2 Chron. 10. c. 9.8. c. 20.8, 16. c. 29, 4 14. E≈øay 49.23. 1 Tim. 2.3. Therefore Kings having no right at all to in jure or oppre≈ø≈øe their people, they neither lawfully can nor ought to do it, either by them≈øelves or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruments; there being nothing more ≈øeverely prohibited and cen≈øured in Scripture then Princes and Magi≈øtrates oppre≈ø≈øion of their Subjects, Prov. 28.15, 16.

Take but one text for many, Ezek. 45.8, 9. <hi>My I'rinces ≈øhal no more expul≈øe my people, and there≈øt of the land ≈øhal they give to the hou≈øe of I≈ørael according to their Tribes.
